# RAILS FINAL PROJECT

Welcome to my final Rails Project! The first version of this application allowed users to create and store a collection of cars.

  2. Add/create individual car entries to be saved to a database, and assign a parking space;
  3. Read/retrieve a car, as well as a list of all cars entered to the database;
  4. Edit/update only entries made by the current user; and 
  5. Delete only entries made by the current user.
