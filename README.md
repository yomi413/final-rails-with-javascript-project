# RAILS APP WITH JAVASCRIPT FRONTEND FINAL PROJECT

## Cars Collection v.3

Welcome to my final Rails App with JavaScript Project! The first version of this application allowed users to create and store a collection of cars using Sinatra. The second version allowed me to expand some features and add functionality using the Rails framework.  In this new verion we continue to grow our app with the use of JavaScript and jQuery. Users will still be able to take the following actions:

  1. Signup for a new account, log in and log out;
  2. Add/create individual car entries to be saved to a database, and assign a parking space;
  3. Read/retrieve a car, as well as a list of all cars entered to the database;
  4. Edit/update only entries made by the current user; and 
  5. Delete only entries made by the current user.
